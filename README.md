2. What is your favorite language feature of JavaScript? Please explain.

It can be used in both the client and server side.
 

3. What annoys you the most about JavaScript? Please explain.

The fact that sometimes you can do "tricks" which are not good practices, for example when adding an empty string to a number, it converts to a string data type.
 

4. When/why would you use a library like jQuery? When would you consider it not advisable?

When you are striving for simplicity and the task is not too complex, I would recomend to use vanilla JS. Otherwise, using a library would be advised.
 

5. What was the toughest bug you encountered, and how did you track it down?

In the project of point number one, I had some issues because when the user was logging in, it was having a weird behavior where sometimes the user information was stored in the state and sometimes not.
I had to check where the data was going once the user was logged in and how it was passed to the different components that needed the information.
